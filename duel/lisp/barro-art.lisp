;;;; barro-art.lisp — LILLE BARRO II's own looks (docs/duel/DUEL_LILLE_V2.md §7). His art is Lille's, shared by reference
;;;; (lille-art.lisp: the bodies, Diagramm, every :lb-* clip, LILLE-DRAW's wings / halos / legs, LB-LOOK's lines and beams);
;;;; this file holds only what is his: the draw hook BR-DRAW (Lille's, then his stance's aim line), his trace lines' floor
;;;; look (BR-TRACE-LOOK, his BRH data) and the 狙擊 gauge's HUD row. The clips Lille never had (the recall :br-recall and its
;;;; strings :br-rc1..3) come in the art batch; until then the moves play Lille's stand-ins (barro.lisp *BR-STAND-INS*).
;;;; Everything here is cosmetic: the sim never reads it. Loaded after lille-art.lisp (its macros and props) and before
;;;; barro.lisp (whose state and knobs these functions read at draw time).

;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------- his clips (DUEL_LILLE_V2 §7, §12: the art batch)
;;; The motions Lille never had, timed to barro.lisp's frame data. JILLIEL's on its rig (the front wing pair's tips are the
;;; rig's hands, Lille's convention; the keys' comments give their aims, azimuth / elevation in the chest frame, + = his
;;; right / up, as lille-art.lisp's); the owl's twins (:br-o-*, its claws are the hands) through the owl kits' :clip-map.
;;; - 回収 the recall :br-recall (8 f; its f0 takes the traces back, its f7 starts the string): the wings flung open wide and
;;;   high, the column arched back and rising (f3-f6) while the traces' light flies into him (BR-DRAW), then drawn in round
;;;   the gathered light (f8 = the strings' first frame).
;;; - the derivative strings, every beat a line fired from the wing tips at him (BR-DRAW draws each tip's line and flash):
;;;   :br-rc0 空收 one beat (f6, both wings), :br-rc1 二連 two (f6 the right wing, f16 the left), :br-rc2 四連 four (f6 R,
;;;   f14 L, f22 R, f32 the launch: both wings swept up from low), :br-rc3 裁き five (f6 R, f12 L, f18 R, f24 L, f36 the
;;;   finisher: risen into NIJUSHI-KO's ring over f26-35, the beam on f36 blowing him back). Each beat: cocked (2-3 f),
;;;   snapped at him on its frame, kicked back.
;;; - :br-to-en (12 f, ranged at f11): folded, rising with the wings thrown open, EN's float. The backstep keeps Lille's
;;;   :lb-w-tenshin (14 f) in JILLIEL; the owl's own :br-o-backstep / :br-o-to-en step the root down by the owl's lift
;;;   (*BR-OWL-LIFT* 0.35) on the frame the form turns ranged (f13 / f11), as :lb-o-tenshin does on Lille's f6.
